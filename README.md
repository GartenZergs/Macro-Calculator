# [Macro-Calculator](https://rotschnabel.github.io/)
## About
This app is an economy calculator for the game Starcraft II. If you've ever wondered how much you can produce when you have for example 3 bases with terran, now you can calculate it and experiment with different production-compositions!


## How does it work?
1. Set your income, by setting the amount of workers and MULES mining minerals and gas.
2. Select the units you want to produce constantly.
3. You should see a red bar rising with the amount of produced units. If the red bar stays under (blue mineral / green gas) bar, you can constantly produce the selected units without any breaks. Costs for supply-depots / pylons are already included.

### Example:

## Remark
As the calculator assumes constant production, it is obviously only useful for protoss and terran. I only included zerg for the sake of completeness.

Have fun!
