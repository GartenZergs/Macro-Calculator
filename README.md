## About
This app is an economy calculator for the game Starcraft II. If you've ever wondered how much you can produce when you have for example 3 bases with terran, now you can calculate it and experiment with different production-compositions!


## How does it work?
1. Set your income, by setting the amount of workers and MULES mining minerals and gas.
2. Select the units you want to produce constantly.
3. You should see a red bar rising with the amount of produced units. If the red bar stays under (blue mineral / green gas) bar, you can constantly produce the selected units without any breaks. Costs for supply-depots / pylons are already included.

### Example:
![Example](/images/calculator_example.png)
Above you see that we are a terran with 3 Base-Saturated Economy (x3 16 Mineral-Worker and x3 6 Gas-Worker). We are preparing for a 4th base and even more worker, so we want to constantly produce 3 workers, which are added to the "production-tab" on the bottom. We also want to constantly produce an army. In our case we chose for continous production of:
* 2 Marauders
* 3 Marines
* 1 Tank
* 2 Medivacs
* Double Upgrades

Our income is visualized by the blue and green bars. If you add units, they will "fill" up with a red bar, visualizing the cost of your production. Obviously the red bars should stay below the blue- and green bars, because you cannot spend more money than you get per minute. As you can see we have a "buffer" of 207 minerals and 100 gas per minute, which we could use to build additional buildings like turrets, CC's etc.


## Remark
As the calculator assumes constant production, it is obviously only useful for protoss and terran. I only included zerg for the sake of completeness.

Have fun!
