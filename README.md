# [Macro-Calculator](https://rotschnabel.github.io/)
## About
This app is an economy calculator for the game Starcraft II.

## How does it work?
1. Set your income, by setting the amount of workers and MULES mining minerals and gas.
2. Selected the units you want to produce constantly.
3. You should see a red bar rising with the amount of produced units. If the red bar stays under (blue mineral / green gas) bar, you can constantly produce the selected units without any breaks. Costs for supply-depots / pylons are already included.

## Remark
As the calculator assumes constant production, it is obviously only useful for protoss and terran. I only included zerg for the sake of completeness.

Have fun!
